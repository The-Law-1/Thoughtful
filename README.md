Pretty much finished. I'm a little bit conflicted about using Firestore vs MongoDB.

It's on firestore for now, in the hopes of deploying it someday, but for now fly.io doesn't seem to work great. I'll try again sometime.
And in May I can try migrating to the raspberry pi.

I can probably do without Nest also.

So I guess I'll see you soon friend.
